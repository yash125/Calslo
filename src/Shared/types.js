        description:'Multiple bookings per time slot allows you to have multiple people book during the same available time slot. Set the maximum number allowed and YouCanBook.me will show that time as free until the number is hit.As you receive each booking in that your open time slot, it will appear as an individual event in your calendar. After your set number of bookings has been received, that time will no longer be available for booking in ColSlo. With Custom Availability you dont have to worry about "soaking up" the slots on all of your existing busy events on your calendar. To block out time simply delete that Custom Availability event from your linked calendar. ',
